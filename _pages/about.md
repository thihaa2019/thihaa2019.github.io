About me
======
I am a 3rd year Statistics PhD student at the [University of California Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu), where I am currently working on Stochastic Control for Energy Storage with [Professor Michael Ludkovski](https://ludkovski.pstat.ucsb.edu). My current research interests lie in the interdisciplinary area of machine learning, energy storage systems, and stochastic control/games.  

I did my undergraduate at the same university where I double majored in Mathematics and Statistics. I studied Machine Learning models for pricing Options with the funding from UCSB [URCA](https://urca.ucsb.edu) and [FRAP](https://urca.ucsb.edu/frap) grants. The poster presentation can be seen [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351945890_Can_Machine_Learning_Models_Price_Options). 

Attached [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QG9sgBt83Uv2jiNKIb0vsRBhfUFb2zAA/view?usp=share_link) is my most recent resume.
